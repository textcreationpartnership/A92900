            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Indeed Jeſus Chriſt hath had more Figures of his Paſſion, then of his Glory; Abel watered the infant earth

               </gap>able Miſeries have acquired him ſo much reputation in the world, that <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> found no better expedient to ſweeten the Miſeries of the captive Iſralites in Egypt, then to make them the Relation of his misfortunes. So that with what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever affliction the Patience of a man hath been tryed, he might alwayes have obſerved in the Hiſtory of <hi>Job</hi> matter of
<pb facs="tcp:119726:7"/>Conſolation; for his life was traverſed with all the miſfortunes, which may be imagined, and his Vertue exerciſed by all the diſgraces, which might render it more illuſtrious: his goods which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in flockes were carried away by ſtrangers, or conſumed by lightning, his houſes were overthrown by the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the winds, his children were buried under their ruines, and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, who ſtirred up all theſe tempeſts, made advice be given him of them the ſame day, to the end, that putting his ſoul in diſorder, impatience or griefe might wreſt reproaches or Blaſphemies from his Mouth. But his hopes proved as vain, as his attempts; he aſſaulted his Body with divers ſtrange diſeaſes, that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be conceived how a man could reſiſt ſo many ſorrows; for their continuance did not ſweeten their violence, their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe did not diminiſh their Number; &amp; of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes the ſame part was affected with
<pb facs="tcp:119726:7"/>contrary Evills, which ſeemed not to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agree together, but to increaſe the ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of this unhappy Innocent. His wife uſed all the Artifices, which are ordinary with her ſexe, to bring him to deſpair; his Friends im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed all their Eloquence to perſwade him that he was guilty, and to take away the comfort which he had from the thought of his Innocence. As their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches and complaints are the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall deſigne of this book, ſo are they the principall ſubject of this Preface; and I beleeve it is very hard to underſtand the Hiſtory of <hi>Job,</hi> if one does not know the motives, which his Friends had to accuſe him, and the reaſons which he had to defend himſelf. Nothing brought more prejudice to this great man, then his Miſery, and that which ſhould have given luſtre to his vertue, gave it but Obſcurity: for his friends who thought that puniſhment was alwayes an effect
<pb facs="tcp:119726:8"/>of the ſin of him, which ſuffers, beleeved him faulty becauſe they ſaw him Miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and not able to accord his I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nocence with divine juſtice, they had rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne a man, then accuſe a God: the Principle upon which they founded their diſcourſes was probable, the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences which they drew thence appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them infallible, the great care which <hi>Job</hi> took to defend himſelf paſſed in their thoughts for Obſtinacy, his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers ſeemed more obſcure then riddles, and his Complaints as guilty as Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies; ſo that they were not injurious to their Neighbour but becauſe they were over zealous for God, and hurt not Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, but becauſe they defended Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. As their Proceeding did not want excuſe, ſo could they not exempt it from fault; for being <hi>Jobs</hi> neighbours, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation which pardons nothing in Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and which makes their ſins as pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick as their Vertues, had ſufficiently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
<pb facs="tcp:119726:8"/>them of his honeſty, the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences which they had with him dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his good Fortune, ought to have aſſured them of the Sanctity of his life, and if they could not know the cauſes of his diſgrace, they ought to have ſuſpended their Judgments, and not condemned him whoſe Vertue was as known as his Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. The Complaints of <hi>Job</hi> were well founded upon more juſt Motives; for his Conſcience reproached him not with Crimes, the Holy Ghoſt which ſpake to men by his Mouth, ſpake inwardly to his Heart, and ſuffered him not to beleeve that he was puniſhed for his ſinne: All theſe Reaſons though had not excuſed his Complaints, if a ſtronger one had not obliged him to make them; but as he was the figure of Jeſus Chriſt, who was to unite Innocence in his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon with the Puniſhment of ſin, and who by a Decree of his Father's Juſtice, was to be the moſt afflisted as he was
<pb facs="tcp:119726:9"/>the moſt juſt of all Men, it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that he defended himſelfe, and that he imployed all his Eloquence to perſwade his friends, that if he were unhappy, he was not guilty. It was this potent Conſideration without Doubt, which furniſhed his Minde with ſo many exc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>llent reaſons: He maintained his own Innocence, for fear Jeſus Chriſt's ſhould be intereſted; he ſpoke with heat, becauſe he pleaded the cauſe of his Maſter, and as he was his Figure as well as his Advocate, he raiſed himſelf above the Condition of a Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall man, be ſtood upon Termes with God, and demanded of him ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Juſtice, then Mercy; This Truth being well weighed, will make it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently appear to all the world, that <hi>JOB</hi> was obliged to ſpeake in powerfull Termes, and that he could not uſe more humble, or modeſt ones, but he muſt betray the honour of Jeſus Chriſt,
<pb facs="tcp:119726:9"/>and leave ſcruple in the minds of the Auditors, which would have wronged the cauſe he defended. Now as the eternall Father hath done nothing but by his Sonne, as he hath Created An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels to carry his orders into the World, Devils to execute his Vengeances, Men to obey his Lawes, Princes to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne his People, Prieſts to make him ſacrifices, the juſt to be his Figures, and Prophets to foretell his wonders, he would have the firſt Booke in the World to be his Apologye, and the moſt ancient of H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſtories to be conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to his Innocence: for the Fathers of the Church agree, that this Diſcourſe is the firſt which the Holy Ghoſt hath dictated, that he had often ſpoken before by the Mouth of Men, but that hee had not written by their Hands, that his Oracles were not known but by Tradition, and that there was yet no holy Scripture which they could conſult to learne his
<pb facs="tcp:119726:10"/>Pleaſure; but they do not agree ſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely concerning the Author of this work; the moſt common opinion though, and me thinkes the moſt reaſonable, is that <hi>JOB</hi> ſeeing himſelf reeſtabliſhed in his former greatneſſe, and entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf with his paſt Miſeries, had written the Hiſtory of them himſelf, and that falling into the hands of <hi>Moſes,</hi> that great Man put them into Verſe for the Conſolation of his people, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belliſhed them with the moſt rich Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and the moſt glittering Figures of Poetry. Indeed I am certain that there is no Booke in the World, where the manner of ſpeaking is more noble, the conceits more generous, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions more rich, and the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons more naturall. Likewiſe it is eaſie to judge, that he who was the Author of it had great lights, and that Revelation or ſtudy had taught him all that a man can know: ſometimes
<pb facs="tcp:119726:10"/>he reaſons like an Exellent Philoſopher, and ſerves himſelf with all the ſecrets of Retorick and Morality, to perſwade or move; ſometimes he Speakes like a ſage Polititian, and deſcribes all the Maximes which States men hold for the conduct of the people: ſometimes he treats like a curious Naturaliſt, and diſcovers the moſt hidden Beauties of Nature; oftentimes he diſcourſeth like a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Divine, and deſcribes to us thoſe adorable Perfections, which ſeperate God ſo nobly from his works; but on what Subject ſoever he ſpeakes he is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes an Oratour, and his Eloquence ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver leaves him; yet we muſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that two things were to be wiſhed in this diſcourſe, not ſo much for its Perfection, as for our contentment: one is, that it were more intelligible, for it is certain there are ſome places ſo dark, that they ſeeme rather Riddles then Truths, and the Earth will never have
<pb facs="tcp:119726:11"/>a perfect Underſtanding of them, if the Spirit, which dictated them, doe not explain them. Nor doe I give my inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations to the Publick, but as Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures, whereof the greateſt Part be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken out of the Fathers, I have this comfort, that I have not failed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, and that my faults have Authors, which render them excuſable. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing, which were to be deſired in this worke for the ſatisfaction of the Reader, is the connexion of Reaſons and conceits: but every one knows that it is the ſtile of the Holy Scripture, and that the connecting its paſſages, is the ſhame, and if I durſt ſay it the deſpair of interpreters; for whether the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the time when theſe Holy Authours wrot, be unknown to us, whether the ſecrets of their language be hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den from us, or laſtly whether it be that the Spirit of God hath other lawes in its diſcourſes then ours; we muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
<pb facs="tcp:119726:11"/>that their Contexture is ſo delicate, that it is imperceptible, and one muſt have a great deal of light, or a great deal of vanity, to promiſe one ſelf to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it. Notwithſtanding I have done what I could to tye together the moſt part of the Paſſages of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe by a connexion which may ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the Reader; but where I conceived that tying them together would do them Violence, I have left them in that Holy diſorder, which obligeth us to adore the greatneſſe of God, and to acknowledge our own weakneſſe.</p>

               <p>Obſerve then,
<note n="4" place="margin">As for me, is my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint to man? and if it were ſo, why ſhould not my ſpirit be troubled?</note> that it is not with you ſo much as with God, that I diſpute, and that I complaine more of his ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour than of yours; for if you have an ill opinion of mine innocence, my afflictions ſerve as an excuſe for your ſuſpitions: But God who reades my heart, cannot be ignorant of it; and when I thinke that he doth not take the paines to make you know

                  <p>IOb <hi>teacheth his friends that the Treaſures of Nature are not ſo hidden, but men by their curioſity diſcover them, but that wiſdome is ſo ſecret, that they cannot finde it without the aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of God.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>WHen this diſcourſe was ended, and Job ſaw that his friends did not ſpeake, he began againe wari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to entertaine them in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, and engaged himſelfe to let them ſee by a long dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the wonders of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that all things are gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by a ſupreame providence and ſince that they have their center and their ends, man
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:119726:140"/>may reaſonably hope that he ſhall have his, and that his ſinnes ſhall be puniſhed, and his vertues recompenced.</p>
               <p>That metall (ſaith he) which maintaines commerce a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Men,
<note n="1" place="margin">Surely there is a veine for the filver, and a place for gold where they fine it.</note> and which findes remedyes for all their needs, hath ſecret veyns where it is hidden: and Gold the moſt noble of metalls, which hath no price it ſelfe, and yet gives it to all things, is ſhut up in mines where Natureworks whole ages to forme it.</p>
               <p>Iron which they imploy to ſo many divers uſes,
<note n="2" place="margin">Iron is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of the the earth, and braſſe is mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten out of the ſtone.</note> which ſerves in warre and Peace, and without which the courage of ſouldiers, and the induſtry of artizans would be unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, is drawne from the entrals of the earth; and braſſe, which ſerves as a recompence to the vertue of Illuſtrius men, and which affords matter of which they make them ſtatues,
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:119726:141"/>is drawne from ſtones which melted by the heat of the fire turne into Mettal.</p>
               <p>Though nature hath taken pleaſure to hide all theſe Met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talls,
<note n="3" place="margin">He ſetteth an end to dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and ſearcheth out all perfection: the ſtones of darkneſſe and the ſhadow of death.</note> induſtry provides man with certaine markes for to diſcover them, and infallible conjectures to know the time when they muſt be drawne out of their Darkneſſe: and though the ſhadow of Death forbids the entry into theſe caves, avarice and curioſity give him courage enough to go downe thither; and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich himſelf with their ſpoyls.</p>
               <p>There are torrents found which divide certaine people from all others,
<note n="4" place="margin">The flood breaketh out from the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant; even the waters for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten of the foot: they are dryed up, they are gone away from men.</note> and where waters are ſo profound and rapid, that ſhutting the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage from travellers, they make the Provinces inacceſſible which they water, and put them in the Ranke of thoſe things which were never ſeen.</p>
               <pb n="255" facs="tcp:119726:141"/>
               <p>There are lands ſeen which brought forth corne,
<note n="5" place="margin">As for the earth, out of it cometh bread, and under it is turned up as it were fire.</note> and which by their fertility con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to the Noutriture of men, which are become bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, and which burnt by the Sunne which ſhined upon them, and dryed with the ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur which heated them, have loſt their firſt fertility.</p>
               <p>Tis true that this loſſe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times is advantagious to them;
<note n="6" place="margin">The ſtones of it are the place of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phires: and it hath duſt of Gold.</note> for it oftens happens that for corne they yeeld pretious ſtones and their Rocks turne into Saphyrs, and their turfes into wedges of Gold.</p>
               <p>But as on the other ſide,
<note n="7" place="margin">There is a path which no fowle know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and which the Vultures eye hath not ſeen.</note> they are ſeparated from the world, and lodged under cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates too hot; the Birds ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fly thither, and Vultures whoſe penetrating ſight can obſerve the prey ſo far, could never yet diſcover them.</p>
               <p>
                  <note n="8" place="margin">The Lions whelps have not troden it, nor the fierce Lyon paſſed by it.</note> Thoſe wilde Beaſts whoſe ſavage humour ſearcheth out
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:119726:142"/>the moſt Solitary places, could never yet finde them, and the Lioneſſes which run every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where when they have loſt their little ones, have never approached them.</p>
               <p>Yet man diſcovers them by his Induſtry,
<note n="9" place="margin">He putteth forth his hand upon the rock; he overturneth the mountains by the roots.</note> as by the Obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy of his labour he pierceth Rocks, throwes down Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, and carries away the Treaſure which they hide within their entralls.</p>
               <p>His hands animated by his Curioſity,
<note n="10" place="margin">He cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth out rivers among the rocks, and his eye ſeeth every precious thing.</note> divert the Courſe of Rivers, breake the Rockes which ſerve them for bankes, and his Eyes enjoying the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of his hands, diſcover all that's rare and beautifull in the World.</p>
               <p>Finally his minde which can not be overcome by dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties,
<note n="11" place="margin">He bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the floods from overflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the thing that is hid, bringeth he forth to light.</note> and which to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount them imployes both force and skill, ſees the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders which the Rivers Cover
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:119726:142"/>with their waters, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the deſigne of Nature reveales her ſecrets, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers all that ſhe hides.</p>
               <p>What ſoever good ſucceſſe he hath in theſe ſearches,
<note n="12" place="margin">But where ſhall wiſdome be ſound? and where is the place of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding?</note> he is not ſo happy, nor ſo dextrous in that of Divine wiſdome; for he knows not where ſhee dwells, and what diligence ſoever he uſe to penetrate her deſigns, he is obliged to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe that ſhe ſurpaſſeth his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and that he ought rather to adore then ſearch after them.</p>
               <p>He knowes not what ſhe is worth,
<note n="13" place="margin">Man knoweth not the price there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; neither is it found in the land of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.</note> and the eſteem which he makes of things of the world, ſufficiently teſtifies that he is ignorant of the price of her; he abuſeth himſelfe groſſely when he perſwades himſelf that he ſhall finde her in the Palce of them, who place all their Happineſſe in Pleaſures.</p>
               <pb n="258" facs="tcp:119726:143"/>
               <p>What diligence ſoever he uſe,
<note n="14" place="margin">The depth ſaith, It is not in me: and the ſea ſaith, It is not with me.</note> he ſhall have much adoe to hear any news of her; for the Abyſſes which ſhut up ſo many Treaſures, confeſſe that they poſſeſſe her not, and the Sea which enticheth it ſelfe with our loſſes, and which makes us pay uſe for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities wich it lends us, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth that ſhe growes not with the Pearls, nor with the Corall:</p>
               <p>Though all things obey Gold,
<note n="15" place="margin">It cannot be gotten for gold, neither ſhall ſilver be weighed for the price thereof.</note> and there is nothing which one may not buy with Silver: * notwithſtaning as Wiſdom hath no Price, ſhe gives and doth not ſell her ſelf, no treaſure can buy her, and Experience teacheth us that the moſt rich are not the moſt wiſe.</p>
               <p>Finally her merit ſurpaſſeth all that India hath of Rarity;
<note n="16" place="margin">It cannot be valued with the gold of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phir, with the precious O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyx, or the Saphire.</note> and it would injure her to compare her with thoſe
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:119726:143"/>ſtuffes, whoſe matter being ſo rich the tincture is more beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull: or with thoſe precious ſtones whoſe luſter is ſo glit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering, and greatneſſe ſo mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous.</p>
               <p>That excellent Gold whoſe Purity the fire cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe;
<note n="17" place="margin">The Gold and the Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtall cannot e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall it: and the exchange of it ſhall not be for jewels of fine gold:</note> the Chryſtall which ſeems to be the laſt attempt of Nature, and makes us finde Heaven on Earth; thoſe great Veſſells of Gold whoſe work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip is yet more precious then the matter, are not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite enough to be given in exchange of wiſdom.</p>
               <p>Thoſe ſtarres with which the firmament adornes it ſelf,
<note n="18" place="margin">No men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhall be made of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, or of Pearles: for the Price of wiſedome is above Rubies.</note> when night drives away the day; that Sun whoſe Beauty makes ſo mary Idolaters, and all thoſe other lights which oblige us to preferre Heaven before Earth, cannot be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with her; but if her beauty beget a deſire in us of
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:119726:144"/>ſeaching her, her dwelling more unknowne then the Rockes, out of which they ſetch the Diamonds, makes us looſe the hope of finding her.</p>
               <p>This Difficulty which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hanceth her price is the cauſe that the Topazes of Ethiopis,
<note n="19" place="margin">The To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paz of Ethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia ſhall not equall it, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall it be valued with pure gold.</note> which ſeem to have the luſtre of Gold, and the Purity of Chryſtall, and thoſe agreeable mixtures of colours, which make the Purple of Kings, are not rich enough to purchaſe her.
<note n="20" place="margin">Whence then cometh wiſdom? and where is the place of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding?</note>
               </p>
               <p>Yet muſt we learn her dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and permit our curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to ſearch the place where ſhe makes her reſidence.</p>
               <p>I know ſhe is hidden from the eyes of men,
<note n="21" place="margin">Seeing it is hid from the eyes of all li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and kept cloſe from the fowles of the aire.</note> that her Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity cannot abide their lookes, and that ſhe hath choſen a Dwelling ſo elevated, that the Birds which make their neſts upon the talleſt Trees, and

Thoſe Angurs themſelves who boaſt of knowing the moſt ſecret things by the flight and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of Birds, are obliged to confeſſe that their knowledge is pure ignorance, and that to diſcover wiſdome all their conjectures are falſe.</p>

               <p>Nor is he like men who ſee at once but one part of the Vniverſe:

               <pb n="346" facs="tcp:119726:187"/>
               <p>I will ſearch for no Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices in my diſcourſes,
<note n="4" place="margin">For truly, my words ſhal not be falſe: he that is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is with thee.</note> they ſhall have no other ornament then thoſe of truth, they ſhall be ſimple and ſolid: with all theſe conditions I perſwade my ſelfe that they will be agreeable to you, and that you will approve what you have hitherto condemned.</p>
               <p>You imagine that God loves not the great,
<note n="5" place="margin">Behold, God is migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth not any: he is mighty in ſtrength and wiſdome.</note> becauſe they are oftentimes unhappy, and that the higheſt fortunes are odious to him, becauſe they are moſt frequently ſet upon; but if it be true that every one loves his like, you ought to beleeve that he hates not the great, ſince he is their Soveraigne, and that he hath no averſion from Kings, ſince they have the honour to be his Images.</p>
               <p>It is true,
<note n="6" place="margin">He pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth not the life of the wicked: but giveth right to the poore.</note> as he preferres Piety before greatneſſe, and makes more eſteeme of vertue

               <p>Yet of what condition ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the juſt are,
<note n="7" place="margin">He with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draweth not his eyes from the righteous: but with kings are they on the throne, yea, he doth eſtabliſh them for ever, and they are exalted.</note> he hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies his eyes open to looke upon them: if Kings adde innocence to their Power he eſtabliſhes their Thrones, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports their Crownes, and procures them as much glory, as they render him obedience and ſubmiſſion.</p>
               <p>If at any time they fall from their fortune,
<note n="8" place="margin">And if they be bound in fetters, and be holden in cords of affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction:</note> if by the inſurrection of their Subjects, or by the uſurpation of their Neighbours they are deſpoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led of their Eſtates, and loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with chaines as heavie, as ſhamefull.</p>
               <p>Their injuſtice is the cauſe of their diſaſter,
<note n="9" place="margin">Then he ſheweth them their worke, and their tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions that they have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded.</note> their crimes pal thunder from heaven upon

               <p>And God is ſo farre from taking pleaſure to make them miſerable,

               <p>If they profit by his advice,
<note n="11" place="margin">If they obey and ſerve him, they ſhall ſpend their dayes in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity, and their yeares in pleaſures.</note> if they prudently uſe his counſells, they ſhall come out of Priſon happily, they ſhall mount againe upon their Throne, they ſhall raigne there with pleaſure, and paſſe the reſt of their yeares in that glorious Pompe, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companies Kings in their Triumphs.</p>
               <pb n="349" facs="tcp:119726:188"/>

               <pb n="350" facs="tcp:119726:189"/>
               <p>God wearied with their Crimes ſhall raiſe a Tempeſt which ſhall cauſe their death,

               <p>If the poore likewiſe fall into any new misfortune,
<note n="15" place="margin">He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livereth the poore in his affliction, and openeth their ears in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion.</note> he will not deſpiſe them by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of their condition, but by the ſame favour which he hath done the great ones, he will deliver them out of their miſery, and beget a deſire in them of praying to him, to the end that he may be obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to help them.</p>
               <p>Wherefore you muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve,

               <p>To avoyd then this miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, I am of opinion,
